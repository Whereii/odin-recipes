        <ol>
            <li>Mix honey, tomato paste, apple cider vinegar, Sriracha sauce, and sesame oil together in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Combine cold water, cornstarch, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl; mix well. Add to honey sauce mixture and mix well. Set aside until needed.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder over chicken.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg in a large bowl. Add remaining salt and garlic powder and mix well. Mix in flour. Combine water and cornstarch in a bowl; add to egg mixture and mix well. Add avocado oil and baking powder; mix well.</li>
            <li>Pour 3 inches of peanut oil into the bottom of a wide, deep pot and heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place 1/2 of chicken pieces into the batter mixture and turn to coat. Scoop tablespoonfuls of chicken and batter into the hot oil. Do not crowd the chicken.
